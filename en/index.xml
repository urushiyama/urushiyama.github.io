      <description>&amp;ldquo;Answer the question within xxx words&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Write more than xxx words&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Keep the abstract within xxx words&amp;rdquo;, &amp;hellip; There are many restrictions to overcome for resting your hands. When using Word or other text editors, it is easy to check the count of words, while when using Excel, mail apps, or online forms, it is not so easy. However, it may be helpful to quickly check the count before you lost the energy to write up.</description>

      <description>How do you debug serial communication while developing with micro-controllers? There are some ways such as typing cu or screen or opening development tools for microcontrollers. However, have you seen a tool with a console, a plotter, and an communication analyzer?
That&amp;rsquo;s why I made this app.
This app comes with:
 &amp;ldquo;Ordinal&amp;rdquo; serial console Line and spectrum plotter Serial communication analyzer (currently on data transmission)  Welcome to report bug and advice This app is under growing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve thought having a website might be useful to write profile data, portfolio, and blog pages since I became a member of the lab. Github pages is a preferred host which is free &amp;amp; have the same domain as projects&amp;rsquo; page will have. I checked some static site generator and decided to use Hugo because its sales talk says it is &amp;ldquo;The world&amp;rsquo;s fastest framework&amp;rdquo;.</description>

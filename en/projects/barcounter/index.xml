      <description>Release Note v1.3.5 Be friendly with users!
NEW FEATURE:
 Add &amp;ldquo;Launch at login&amp;rdquo; option
 Remove &amp;ldquo;Auto-Adjust display&amp;rdquo; option (because the app can count words of multi-language)
 Add Japanese localization  FIXED:
 The issue that hyphen caused the count to be less than actual  v1.2.1 People prefer sanitized and cleaned ones, right?
NEW FEATURE:
 Display the count as shorten-width
 Estimate the language of the text and count words  FIXED:</description>
